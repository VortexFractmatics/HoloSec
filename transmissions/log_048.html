    <h1>The Parking Lot Trap</h1>
    <span class="date">CASE STUDY: 055</span>

    <p>It was 8:45 AM. The CEO of a mid-sized logistics firm stepped out of his car. On the pavement, right next to his designated spot, lay a silver 64GB USB drive. It had a piece of masking tape on it. In sharpie, someone had written: <em>"Payroll 2025 - Exec Bonuses."</em></p>

    <p>Human curiosity is the most dangerous vulnerability in any system.</p>

    <p>He picked it up. He walked to his office. He bypassed the IT desk. He plugged it into his laptop. He wanted to see the bonuses.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Within 400 milliseconds, the drive executed a script. It wasn't a storage drive; it was a Human Interface Device (HID) mimicking a keyboard. It opened PowerShell, downloaded a payload, and encrypted the entire company network.</p>

    <p>The ransom was $4 million. They paid it.</p>

    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Hardware is not neutral. Unknown hardware is hostile. HoloSec drives are encrypted by default. If you lose one in a parking lot, the finder sees nothing. It is a brick. Protect yourself from your own mistakes.</p>
